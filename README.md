# Google Books API Consumer

The main objective of this project is consume "Google Books API". This API let me implement Google Books features like: 

- Search and browse through the list of books that match a given query.
- View information about a book, including metadata, availability and price, links to the preview page.
- Manage your own bookshelves.

Also, to complement this project I'm using "Youtube API" that gives links to implement youtube videos directly in the project.

## :warning: Important warning

As this project was made for a Front-End job position, I opted to use the limited hours to develop the features and don't implemented responsive logic. So use a desktop to build and test application.
